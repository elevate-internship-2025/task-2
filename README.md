**Task 2 — To-Do List Web App**

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Web Development Internship.

The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them instantly without page reload.
The UI is clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly, focusing on DOM manipulation and event handling.


🎯**Features Implemented**

✔ Add Tasks

Users can type a task and click “Add” or press Enter to insert it into the list.

✔ Mark Tasks as Complete

Clicking the check button toggles a completed state with strike-through styling.

✔ Delete Tasks

Each task includes a delete icon that removes it instantly.

✔ Clear Completed Tasks

A dedicated button removes all completed tasks at once.

✔ Dynamic UI Updates

All interactions happen using JavaScript in real-time — no reload needed.

✔ Responsive Design

The layout adapts for mobile screens.
